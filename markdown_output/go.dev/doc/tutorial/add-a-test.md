# Add a test

Now that you've gotten your code to a stable place (nicely done, by the way), add a test. Testing your code during development can expose bugs that find their way in as you make changes. In this topic, you add a test for the `Hello` function.

**Note:** This topic is part of a multi-part tutorial that begins with [Create a Go module](/doc/tutorial/create-module.html).

Go's built-in support for unit testing makes it easier to test as you go. Specifically, using naming conventions, Go's `testing` package, and the `go test` command, you can quickly write and execute tests.

1.  In the greetings directory, create a file called greetings\_test.go.
    
    Ending a file's name with \_test.go tells the `go test` command that this file contains test functions.
    
2.  In greetings\_test.go, paste the following code and save the file.
    
    package greetings
    
    import (
        "testing"
        "regexp"
    )
    
    // TestHelloName calls greetings.Hello with a name, checking
    // for a valid return value.
    func TestHelloName(t \*testing.T) {
        name := "Gladys"
        want := regexp.MustCompile(\`\\b\`+name+\`\\b\`)
        msg, err := Hello("Gladys")
        if !want.MatchString(msg) || err != nil {
            t.Errorf(\`Hello("Gladys") = %q, %v, want match for %#q, nil\`, msg, err, want)
        }
    }
    
    // TestHelloEmpty calls greetings.Hello with an empty string,
    // checking for an error.
    func TestHelloEmpty(t \*testing.T) {
        msg, err := Hello("")
        if msg != "" || err == nil {
            t.Errorf(\`Hello("") = %q, %v, want "", error\`, msg, err)
        }
    }
    
    In this code, you:
    
    *   Implement test functions in the same package as the code you're testing.
    *   Create two test functions to test the `greetings.Hello` function. Test function names have the form `Test_Name_`, where _Name_ says something about the specific test. Also, test functions take a pointer to the `testing` package's [`testing.T` type](/pkg/testing/#T) as a parameter. You use this parameter's methods for reporting and logging from your test.
    *   Implement two tests:
        *   `TestHelloName` calls the `Hello` function, passing a `name` value with which the function should be able to return a valid response message. If the call returns an error or an unexpected response message (one that doesn't include the name you passed in), you use the `t` parameter's [`Errorf` method](/pkg/testing/#T.Errorf) to print a message to the console.
        *   `TestHelloEmpty` calls the `Hello` function with an empty string. This test is designed to confirm that your error handling works. If the call returns a non-empty string or no error, you use the `t` parameter's [`Errorf` method](/pkg/testing/#T.Errorf) to print a message to the console.
3.  At the command line in the greetings directory, run the [`go test` command](/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages) to execute the test.
    
    The `go test` command executes test functions (whose names begin with `Test`) in test files (whose names end with \_test.go). You can add the `-v` flag to get verbose output that lists all of the tests and their results.
    
    The tests should pass.
    
    $ go test
    PASS
    ok      example.com/greetings   0.364s
    
    $ go test -v
    === RUN   TestHelloName
    --- PASS: TestHelloName (0.00s)
    === RUN   TestHelloEmpty
    --- PASS: TestHelloEmpty (0.00s)
    PASS
    ok      example.com/greetings   0.372s
    
4.  Break the `greetings.Hello` function to view a failing test.
    
    The `TestHelloName` test function checks the return value for the name you specified as a `Hello` function parameter. To view a failing test result, change the `greetings.Hello` function so that it no longer includes the name.
    
    In greetings/greetings.go, paste the following code in place of the `Hello` function. Note that the highlighted lines change the value that the function returns, as if the `name` argument had been accidentally removed.
    
    // Hello returns a greeting for the named person.
    func Hello(name string) (string, error) {
        // If no name was given, return an error with a message.
        if name == "" {
            return name, errors.New("empty name")
        }
        // Create a message using a random format.
        // message := fmt.Sprintf(randomFormat(), name)
        message := fmt.Sprint(randomFormat())
        return message, nil
    }
    
5.  At the command line in the greetings directory, run `go test` to execute the test.
    
    This time, run `go test` without the `-v` flag. The output will include results for only the tests that failed, which can be useful when you have a lot of tests. The `TestHelloName` test should fail -- `TestHelloEmpty` still passes.
    
    $ go test
    --- FAIL: TestHelloName (0.00s)
        greetings\_test.go:15: Hello("Gladys") = "Hail, %v! Well met!", <nil>, want match for \`\\bGladys\\b\`, nil
    FAIL
    exit status 1
    FAIL    example.com/greetings   0.182s
    

In the next (and last) topic, you'll see how to compile and install your code to run it locally.
