# Return a random greeting

In this section, you'll change your code so that instead of returning a single greeting every time, it returns one of several predefined greeting messages.

**Note:** This topic is part of a multi-part tutorial that begins with [Create a Go module](/doc/tutorial/create-module.html).

To do this, you'll use a Go slice. A slice is like an array, except that its size changes dynamically as you add and remove items. The slice is one of Go's most useful types.

You'll add a small slice to contain three greeting messages, then have your code return one of the messages randomly. For more on slices, see [Go slices](/blog/slices-intro) in the Go blog.

1.  In greetings/greetings.go, change your code so it looks like the following.
    
    package greetings
    
    import (
        "errors"
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
    )
    
    // Hello returns a greeting for the named person.
    func Hello(name string) (string, error) {
        // If no name was given, return an error with a message.
        if name == "" {
            return name, errors.New("empty name")
        }
        // Create a message using a random format.
        message := fmt.Sprintf(randomFormat(), name)
        return message, nil
    }
    
    // randomFormat returns one of a set of greeting messages. The returned
    // message is selected at random.
    func randomFormat() string {
        // A slice of message formats.
        formats := \[\]string{
            "Hi, %v. Welcome!",
            "Great to see you, %v!",
            "Hail, %v! Well met!",
        }
    
        // Return a randomly selected message format by specifying
        // a random index for the slice of formats.
        return formats\[rand.Intn(len(formats))\]
    }
    
    In this code, you:
    
    *   Add a `randomFormat` function that returns a randomly selected format for a greeting message. Note that `randomFormat` starts with a lowercase letter, making it accessible only to code in its own package (in other words, it's not exported).
    *   In `randomFormat`, declare a `formats` slice with three message formats. When declaring a slice, you omit its size in the brackets, like this: `[]string`. This tells Go that the size of the array underlying the slice can be dynamically changed.
    *   Use the [`math/rand` package](https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand/) to generate a random number for selecting an item from the slice.
    *   In `Hello`, call the `randomFormat` function to get a format for the message you'll return, then use the format and `name` value together to create the message.
    *   Return the message (or an error) as you did before.
2.  In hello/hello.go, change your code so it looks like the following.
    
    You're just adding Gladys's name (or a different name, if you like) as an argument to the `Hello` function call in hello.go.
    
    package main
    
    import (
        "fmt"
        "log"
    
        "example.com/greetings"
    )
    
    func main() {
        // Set properties of the predefined Logger, including
        // the log entry prefix and a flag to disable printing
        // the time, source file, and line number.
        log.SetPrefix("greetings: ")
        log.SetFlags(0)
    
        // Request a greeting message.
        message, err := greetings.Hello("Gladys")
        // If an error was returned, print it to the console and
        // exit the program.
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    
        // If no error was returned, print the returned message
        // to the console.
        fmt.Println(message)
    }
    
3.  At the command line, in the hello directory, run hello.go to confirm that the code works. Run it multiple times, noticing that the greeting changes.
    
    $ go run .
    Great to see you, Gladys!
    
    $ go run .
    Hi, Gladys. Welcome!
    
    $ go run .
    Hail, Gladys! Well met!
    

Next, you'll use a slice to greet multiple people.
