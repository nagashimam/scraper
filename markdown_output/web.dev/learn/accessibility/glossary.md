# Glossary Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Here are some common terms and concepts for accessibility. This guide is includes key terms for web accessibility that we discuss within the course. For more technical terminology, refer to the [WCAG glossary](https://www.wcag.com/resource/wcag-com-glossary/).

To better understand language around disability and accessibility, read our [inclusive language style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).

## A11y

[A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/a11y-and-other-numeronyms/) is numeronym for accessibility (a + 11 letters + y). Typically pronounced as "ally" as in "a person or group that provides assistance and support in an ongoing effort, activity, or struggle," giving the term "a11y" multiple meanings.

## Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)

The [ACR](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2021/10/15/introduction-to-accessibility-conformance-reports/) is the final report presented to a client once a full ACT has been performed. If you need a legally binding version of the ACR, you would use a version of the [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](#vpat).

## Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT)

[ACT](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/) is commonly referred to as an accessibility audit. The ACT uses various testing methodology and tools: primarily automated, manual, and [assistive technology](#at) (AT) devices.

ACT is first performed as a baseline metric to gauge general accessibility compliance of a digital product. It's often run multiple times throughout the software product lifecycle to check for changes in the level of conformance against a set of pre-determined accessibility checkpoints or guidelines.

## ARIA

[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) is an acronym for Accessible Rich Internet Applications (formally known as WAI-ARIA—Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications). ARIA is a specification written by the W3C, defining a set of attributes that you can add to HTML elements to support accessibility. These attributes communicate role, state, and property to assistive technologies with accessibility APIs implemented in the accessibility tree in modern browsers.

## Assistive technology (AT)

[AT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology) is hardware and software that can be no-tech (such as a mouthstick), low-tech (such as a keyboard), or high-tech (such as a screen reader). AT is used to help increase, maintain, or improve the capabilities of performing a task for a person with disabilities. AT includes braille keyboards, audio browsers, screen magnifiers, and alternative pointing devices.

## Captions: Closed and open

_Captions_ are words that describe the audio or sound portion of a program or video. Captions include dialogue, identify who is speaking, and include non-speech information conveyed through sound, including meaningful sound effects. Captions should be included with [prerecorded content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-prerecorded.html) and [live content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-live), to help people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have other auditory processing disabilities have equal access to multimedia content.

There are two types of captions. _Closed captions_ can be turned on and off by the viewer, while _open captions_ (sometimes referred to as subtitles) cannot.

## Digital accessibility

[Digital accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) is the practice of building digital products so that all users, regardless of their disability, have equal access to the content or functionality of the product.

## POUR

[POUR](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/) is shorthand for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust, which are the foundational human-focused principles of WCAG.

## Screen reader

A [screen reader](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers) is a high-tech assistive technology that uses synthetic language to read and navigate digital documents for people with low or no vision, cognitive issues, and other disabilities.

## VPAT

[VPAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Product_Accessibility_Template) is shorthand for Voluntary Product Accessibility Template. A VPAT is a template to draft an [Accessibility Conformance Report](#acr) (ACR). An ACR clearly states which accessibility standards a product or service meets and warns users about any "accessibility blockers" they may encounter.

VPATs are reports of the state of a product from an accessibility conformance perspective. The existence of VPAT alone doesn't guarantee that a digital product is 100% accessible.

## Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

The [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) is a sub-group of the W3C focuses only on digital accessibility.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (commonly referred to as [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) is an international set of accessibility standards developed through the W3C, in cooperation with individuals and organizations. WCAG's goal is to provide a single, shared standard for digital accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide.
