This course breaks down the fundamentals of CSS into clear, digestible pieces. Over the next few modules, you'll learn how the core aspects of CSS work and how to use them effectively in your projects. Use the menu pane by the "Learn CSS" logo to navigate the modules.

You'll learn CSS fundamentals like the box model, cascade and specificity, flexbox, grid, and z-index. You'll also learn about functions, color types, gradients, logical properties and inheritance to make you a well-rounded frontend developer, ready to take on any user interface.

Each module is full of interactive demos and self-assessments for you to test your knowledge. In addition to learning through reading and demos, there's a podcast episode accompanying each topic as another way to learn and continue expanding your knowledge.

This course is created for both beginner and advanced CSS developers.
