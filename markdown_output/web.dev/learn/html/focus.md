# Focus Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Interactive elements, including [form controls](/learn/html/forms), [links](/learn/html/links), and buttons, are by default focusable and tabbable. Tabbable elements are part of the document's sequential focus navigation order. Other elements are inert, meaning they are not interactive. With HTML attributes, it's possible to make interactive elements inert and to make inert elements interactive.

**Note:** For usability and accessibility, always make sure that the user knows which element has focus. Include CSS [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:focus), [`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible), and (optionally) [`:focus-within`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within) styles. There are modules dedicated to focus styles in both [Learn CSS](/learn/css/focus) and [Learn Accessibility](/learn/accessibility/focus).

By default, the navigation focus order is the same as the visual order, which is the source code order. There are HTML attributes that can alter this order and CSS properties that can alter the visual order of content. Changing the tabbing order with HTML or visual rendering order with CSS can harm user experience.

Don't alter the perceived and actual tabbing order with CSS and HTML. As the following two examples demonstrate, tab orders that differ from the visually expected order are confusing to users and bad for user experience.

In this example, the value of the [`tabindex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute has made the tab order chaotic:

In this example, CSS has created a divergence between the tabbing order and the visual order of the content:

The [`flex-flow: row-reverse;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/flex-flow) declaration has reversed the visual order. In addition, the CSS [order](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/order) property was applied to the sixth word, "This", which visually moved that one word. The tabbing sequence is the order of the code, which no longer matches the visual order, creating a disconnect for keyboard users.

**Note:** CSS features, including [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox),[grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), [positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning), [transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/translate), and [multi-column](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout), can alter the visual order of content. It's important you make sure your content maintains a logical tabbing order, on all viewport sizes. Test your content by tabbing through it with a keyboard: with shift + tab to move backwards through the content. Use CSS to indicate which element has focus. Don't reorder focusable elements with CSS.

## Make inert elements interactive

The `contenteditable` and `tabindex` attributes, being global attributes, can be added to any element, making them focusable in the process. Focusable elements can also be focused with a mouse or pointer, by having the [`autofocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute set, or by script, such as with [`element.focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus).

### The `tabindex` attribute

The global [`tabindex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute, introduced in [attributes](/learn/html/attributes#tabindex), enables elements that otherwise wouldn't be able to receive focus to get focus, usually with Tab, hence the name.

The `tabindex` attribute takes as its value an integer. A negative value makes an element focusable but not tabbable. A `tabindex` value of `0` makes the element focusable and tabbable, adding the element on which it's applied to the sequential focus navigation order in source code order. A value of 1 or greater makes the element focusable and tabbable, but adds it to a prioritized tabbing sequence and should be avoided.

On this page, the share button, `<share-action>`, is a [custom element](/learn/html/template). The `tabindex="0"` adds this not-normally focusable element into the keyboard default tabbing order:

```
<share-action authors="@front-end.social/@estellevw" data-action="click" data-category="web.dev" data-icon="share" data-label="share, mastodon" role="button" tabindex="0">
  <svg aria-label="share" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <use href="#shareIcon" />
  </svg>
  <span>Share</span>
</share-action>
```

**Note:** The [`role="button"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role) informs screen reader users that this element should behave like a [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). When creating custom elements which mimic existing semantic elements, include an [ARIA role](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles). The element must provide all the features of the element being replicated. This can be done by extending the replicated element, such as extending the [`HTMLButtonElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement), or by adding `tabindex="0"` and using JavaScript to program _all_ the functionality of the element it's mimicking, including handling pointer events and the Enter and Space key presses. If `<button>` had been used for the button instead of creating a custom element, the `tabindex` and `role` attributes would have been unnecessary, and the browser would have provided the pointer and keyboard events.

There's another custom element on this page: the [local navigation](/learn/html/navigation#local_navigation) has a custom element with a negative `tabindex` value:

```
<web-navigation-drawer type="standard" tabindex="-1">
```

A `tabindex` attribute with a negative value makes the element focusable but not tabbable. The element is capable of receiving focus, such as using [`HTMLElement.focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus), but it's not part of the sequential focus navigation order. The convention for non-tabbable, focusable elements is to use `tabindex="-1"`. If you add `tabindex="-1"` to an interactive element, it will no longer be tabbable.

The [`element.focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) method can be used to set focus to focusable elements. Browsers scroll focused elements into view. For this reason, avoid the use of `element.focus({preventScroll:true})`, as focusing on a non-visible element is a bad user experience.

If you want to query the document to find out which element has focus, use the read-only [`Document.activeElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement) property.

Elements with a `tabindex` of `1` or greater are included in a separate tab sequence. As you'll notice in the Codepen, tabbing begins in a separate sequence, in order of lowest value to highest value, before going through those in the regular sequence (no `tabindex` set, or `tabindex="0"`) in source order:

`tabindex` with a positive value puts the element into a prioritized focus sequence, which can lead to focus order chaos. Avoid [modifying the DOM order with `tabindex`](/articles/using-tabindex). Not only can altered tabbing orders create bad user experiences, they are difficult for developers to manage and maintain.

### The `contenteditable` attribute

The [`contenteditable`](/learn/html/attributes#contenteditable) attribute was discussed earlier. Setting `contenteditable="true"` on any element makes it editable, focusable, and part of the tab order. The focus behavior is similar to setting `tabindex="0"`, but not the same. Nested `contenteditable` elements are focusable but not tabbable. To make a nested `contenteditable` element tabbable, add `tabindex="0"`, which add it to the sequential focus navigation order.

## Give `autofocus` to interactive elements

While the boolean [`autofocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) is a global attribute that can be set on any element, it doesn't make an inert element interactive. When the page loads, the first focusable element with the `autofocus` attributes receives focus, as long as that element is displayed and not nested in a [`<dialog>`](/learn/html/dialog).

Automatically setting focus on content can be confusing. Setting `autofocus` on a form control means that the form control scrolls into view on page load. All your users, including screen reader users and users with small viewports, may not "see" the instructions for the form, possibly even scrolling past the form control's normally visible label. The `autofocus` attribute doesn't alter the document's sequential focus navigation order. The elements in the sequence coming before the auto-focused element are skipped. For these reasons, it's not advised to include the `autofocus` attribute.

The exception to the "don't use `autofocus`" recommendation is including the `autofocus` attribute within `<dialog>` elements. When a dialog is opened, the browser automatically focuses on the first focusable interactive element within the `<dialog>`, which means it's unnecessary to add `autofocus` to an element. If you want to be sure a specific interactive element within the dialog receives focus when the dialog opens, add the `autofocus` attribute to that element.

```
<dialog open>
  <form method="dialog">
    <button type="submit" autofocus>close</button>
  </form>
</dialog>
```

The `autofocus` attribute set on the close `<button>` allow it to receive focus when the dialog is opened. As the first element in the dialog, it would have received focus in any case. By default, when a dialog is opened, the first focusable element within the dialog receives focus unless a different element within the dialog has the `autofocus` attribute set.

## Make interactive elements inert

There are also HTML attributes that can remove interactive elements from the tabbing sequence. Including a negative `tabindex` to focusable elements, adding the `disabled` attribute to supporting form controls, and adding the global `inert` attribute to a container all make elements un-tabbable. These three attributes are NOT interchangeable.

### Negative `tabindex` value

A `tabindex` attribute with a negative value makes an element focusable, but not tabbable. While adding `tabindex="0"` to a focusable-by-default element, including links, buttons, form controls, and elements that are `contenteditable` is not necessary; including a `tabindex` with a negative value removes normally tabbable elements from the sequential focus navigation order.

A negative `tabindex` value prevents keyboard users from focusing on interactive elements, but doesn't disable the element. Pointer users can still focus on the element. To disable an element, use the `disabled` attribute.

### Disabled

The boolean [disabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) attribute makes the form controls on which it's applied and their descendants, if any, unfocusable. Disabled form controls can't be focused, don't get click events, and are not submitted upon form submission.

`disabled` is not a global attribute. It applies to `<button>`, `<input>`, `<optgroup>`, `<option>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, form-associated custom elements, and [`<fieldset>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset). When set on `<optgroup>` or `<fieldset>`, all the child form controls are disabled, except for the contents of the `<fieldset>`'s first [`<legend>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend).

The same elements that support `disabled` are also targetable with the [`:disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:disabled) and [`:enabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:enabled) pseudo-classes. Elements that are disabled with the `disabled` attribute are generally styled as light gray with the user-agent stylesheet, even if an [`accent-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) is set.

Being a boolean attribute, the presence of the attribute disables the otherwise enabled element; you can't set it to `false`. To re-enable a disabled element, the attribute has to be removed, generally with [`Element.removeAttribute('disabled')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute).

The [`HTMLInputElement.disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/disabled) property lets you check if an input is disabled. As `disabled` is not a global attribute, it's not inherited from the HTMLElement, but every supporting element interface, like [`HTMLSelectElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement/disabled), [`HTMLTextareaElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement#instance_properties), has the same read-only property.

The `disabled` attribute doesn't apply to normally `inert` elements that are made focusable with `tabindex` or `contenteditable`, nor does it apply to the `<form>` element. To disable these elements, the global `inert` attribute can be used.

### The `inert` attribute

When the `inert` global boolean attribute is added to an element, that element and all nested content become disabled, which means they cannot be clicked or tabbed to. They are also removed from the accessibility tree. While `inert` can be applied to any element, it's generally used for sections of content, such as offscreen or otherwise hidden content.

When applying `disabled` to form controls, the browser provides default styling and can be styled using the [`:disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:disabled) pseudo class. The `inert` attribute provides no visual indicators and has no matching pseudoclass (though the `[inert]` [attribute selector](/learn/css/selectors#attribute_selector) matches).

Using `inert` on visible content without styles indicating the inertness can lead to poor user experience. As inert content is not available to screen reader users, it can lead to confusion when sighted screen reader users see content on screen that is not available to the accessibility tools. Make inertness very apparent with CSS.

Make sure that the focus never moves to non-visible content. Anything rendered off-screen that does not automatically come into view when focused should be made [inert](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/inert). If content is hidden, but comes into view when focused, like a [skip to content link](/learn/html/navigation#skip_to_content_link), it does not need to be made inert.
