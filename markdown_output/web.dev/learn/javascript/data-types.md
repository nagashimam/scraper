# Data types and structures Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Primitives are the simplest types of data in JavaScript. A _primitive literal_ is a value, with no wrapper or properties of its own. Primitive literals are _immutable_, meaning they can't be changed to represent other values in the same way that JavaScript's more complex object-based data structures can. For example, while the value of a variable named `theTruth` can be reassigned a value of `false`, the boolean literal `true` can never represent any value other than `true`, in the same way the number literal `5` can never represent the value of another number.

There are seven primitive data types:

*   [Numbers](/learn/javascript/data-types/number)
*   [Strings](/learn/javascript/data-types/string)
*   [Booleans](/learn/javascript/data-types/boolean)
*   [`null`](/learn/javascript/data-types/null-undefined#null)
*   [`undefined`](/learn/javascript/data-types/null-undefined#undefined)
*   [BigInt](/learn/javascript/data-types/bigint)
*   [Symbol](/learn/javascript/data-types/symbol)
