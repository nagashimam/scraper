## Progressive Web Apps

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device, all with a single codebase.

## Getting started

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

If you want to build a Progressive Web App, you may be wondering where to start, if it's possible to upgrade a website to a PWA without starting from scratch, or how to move from a platform-specific app to a PWA. This article will help you answer these questions.

## Foundations

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

All Progressive Web Apps are, at their core, modern websites, so it's important that your website has a solid foundation in responsive design, mobile and everything first, intrinsic design, and web performance.

## App design

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

One of the key differences between Progressive Web Apps and classic websites and web apps is installability. This creates a standalone experience more integrated into the platform and operating system. Installation enables new flexibility and new responsibility, as we won't have a browser's user interface around our content.

## Assets and data

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

A Progressive Web App is a website; all its assets are the same as on the web, but with new tools to make those assets load fast when online andavailable when offline.

## Service workers

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

Service workers are a fundamental part of a PWA. They enable fast loading (regardless of the network), offline access, push notifications, and other capabilities.

## Caching

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

You can use the Cache Storage API to download, store, delete or update assets on the device. Then these assets can be served on the device without needing a network request.

## Workbox

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

Workbox is a set of modules that simplify common service worker interactions such as routing and caching. Each module addresses a specific aspect of service worker development. Workbox aims to make using service workers as easy as possible while allowing the flexibility to accommodate complex application requirements where needed.

## Web app manifest

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

The web app manifest is a JSON file that defines how the PWA should be treated as an installed application, including the look and feel and basic behavior within the operating system.

## Installation prompt

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

For sites that pass the PWA install criteria, the browser triggers an event to prompt the user to install it. The good news is that you can use this event to customize your prompt and invite users to install your app.

## Detection

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_ _keyboard\_arrow\_up_

_subject_ Article

Identifying how your users interact with your app is useful in customizing and improving the user experience. For example, you can check whether your app is already installed on the user's device and implement features such as transferring navigation to the standalone app from the browser.
